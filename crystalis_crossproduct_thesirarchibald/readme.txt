The "Intermediate" tracker preset technically has different flags from the website.
Specifically, the tracker assumes the flags Hw and Hb

	Hw - Battle magic not guaranteed
		With Intermediate flags, you will get a Bracelet to kill
		Kelbesque, Sabera, and Mado, or Ball of Thunder to kill Karmine.
		The tracker will assume you can kill them as long as you have the
		correct sword. Later versions of the tracker will appropriately
		show this as a sequence break (yellow) when using the "Intermediate" variant.

	Hb - Barrier not guaranteed
		With Intermediate flags, you will be able to find Barrier (or
		Shield Ring + Refresh) to bypass spitting Gargoyles. The
		Intermediate tracker ignores this requirement altogether. I
		may or may not alter this in the future. On the one hand,
		skipping Barrier by grabbing Medical Herbs is so trivially
		easy. On the other hand, understanding sequence breaks may
		help routing.


For the "Custom Flags" variant, the overworld locations and sub map locations DO NOT
update each other! (Kelb 2 is the only exception) However, if you mark off all visible
locations within a sub map, the tracker will turn the overworld square gray. For areas
with sub maps, I recommend using EITHER the World Map markers OR the sub map markers.
If you try to use both, it will get confusing. Because of the way EmoTracker's
infrastructure is, this may not change for a while. It's a little complicated, but
in practice it should work fine as long as you commit to one method for marking off
your locations.
